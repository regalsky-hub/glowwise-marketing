      <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
      <p>We use your data only for the following purposes:</p>

        <li><strong>Contract:</strong> for providing the GlowWise service you&apos;ve signed up for</li>

      <h2>5. How we store and protect your data</h2>
      <p>Your data is stored on secure servers operated by trusted infrastructure providers (Google Firebase). All data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256). Passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms and are never visible to us.</p>
      <p>Data may be processed in the UK, EU, or other countries with adequate data protection standards. Where data is transferred outside the UK or EU, we use Standard Contractual Clauses or other approved safeguards.</p>

        <li><strong>Payment processors</strong> (Stripe) — only billing information, never your wellness data</li>
        <li><strong>Authorities</strong> — only when legally required (e.g. court order or law enforcement request)</li>
      </ul>

        <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong> revoke consent at any time</li>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>While your account is active:</strong> we keep your data to provide the service</li>
        <li><strong>If you delete your account:</strong> all personal data is permanently deleted within 30 days, except where we are legally required to keep records (e.g. tax records, fraud prevention)</li>
        <li><strong>Inactive accounts:</strong> if your account remains unused for 24 months, we will email you and may delete it after a further 30 days</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>9. Children&apos;s privacy</h2>
      <p>GlowWise is not intended for anyone under 18. We do not knowingly collect data from minors. If we learn we have collected data from someone under 18, we will delete it immediately.

      <h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we&apos;ll email you and update the &quot;Last updated&quot; date above. Continued use of GlowWise after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

      <h2>12. Contact us</h2>
      <p>For any privacy questions, data requests, or concerns, please email <a href="mailto:privacy@glowwise.app">privacy@glowwise.app</a>. We aim to resolve every issue directly with you and will respond within one calendar month.</p>
